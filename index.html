        <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 120%;">Writing code can be complicated, but with the right support and tools you can make the process much easier. To become an outstanding programmer, you need version control support, as well as support from other people writing code. Whether they are members of your team or generally knowledgeable depending on the type of problem to be solved, having individuals who can help develop size availability and talent is crucial in programming areas.

            GitHub brings together teams and assemblers on one common platform where they can share assemblers and methods and create great software together. But what is GitHub, what is GitHub for, how does it work, and what makes it so useful?

            <h2 id="part1">What is GitHub?</h2>
<p>
    GitHub is one of the largest developer communities in the world. It is a platform that encourages collaboration and communication between developers. GitHub has a number of useful features that allow development teams to work together on the same project and easily create new versions of software without disrupting existing versions, but that's not all.</p>
<h2 id="part2">What are the benefits of GitHub?</h2>
<p>
    Why use GitHub? There are several reasons for this. The first is that it enables slick and easy collaboration and version control. This allows you to work on code with anyone from anywhere. Additionally, many employers use GitHub. So if you're planning on getting a job, you'll look really good if you already know your way around GitHub. Don't forget the connections, learning, and portfolio aspects as well. GitHub is a robust learning and collaboration platform. Take your time to explore and see how much it can expand your programming knowledge.
    
    GitHub may seem complicated, but understanding a few basics will help you get off to a good start. Github works with “Git”. Git is a widely used software in the software world. We will mention the details below.</p>

<h2 id="part3">What is Git?</h2>
<p>
    Git is a version control system created by programming icon Linus Torvald. He initially created Git to track source code changes while developing the Linux operating system. Git helps programmers collaborate, coordinate work, and work together on complex code and development projects. Git tracks changes and helps teams work remotely on complex programs.
</p>
<h2 id="part4">How to Use GitHub?</h2>
<p>
To use GitHub, you first need to complete a few steps. How to use GitHub:
</p>

<h3 id="subtitle1">1-Sign up for GitHub</h3>
<p>
To use GitHub, you will need a GitHub account. You can create a free GitHub account here and start using GitHub immediately. With a free account, you will get access to unlimited public and private pools. You'll also get bug tracking and project management features. The only downside is that only three collaborators will be allowed for the private repository. If you're still in the "GitHub for beginners" phase, signing up for a free account is a great place to start.
</p>

<h3 id="subtitle2">2-Install Git</h3>
<p>
    GitHub runs on Git. <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Click here</a> to install Git on your computer. Those who know how to use Git prefer to make changes using the command line within Git. For our purposes though, we'll focus on how to get things done on GitHub.
</p>

<h3 id="subtitle3">3-Create a Repository</h3>
<p>To do anything on GitHub, you first need to know how to create a repository. A repository is essentially synonymous with the word “project.” Simply put, a repo stores everything related to a particular project, including files, images, spreadsheets, datasets, and videos, usually sequentially as files. The best use is to add a README file to your repo with specific information about the given project. On GitHub, you can add a README file when you create a new repo.
To create a new repo, you must click “New repository” in the upper right corner.
</p>
<img src="images/gitrepo.png" alt="repository" style="width: 450px; height: 300px;">

 
<p>
You can then name your repo, add a short description, and check the box that says “Add a README file” to say “start this repo with a README.” Finally, you can complete the process by clicking “Create Repository”.
</p>

<h3 id="subtitle4">4-Create a Branch</h3>
<p>
Projects are versatile and require many program versions when building. Branching allows you to edit multiple unique versions of a repository simultaneously. Your repo automatically has a definitive branch named “main”. You can work on a few different branches to make edits before finally saving it to the main project.

When a new branch is started, it becomes a copy of the master branch until you edit it to make new changes. The branching process aims to take a copy of the main software and make certain improvements on it. A Branch usually goes through many steps and approvals before being merged into the main software. To start a new branch on GitHub, go to your new repo, click on the drop-down menu that says “main,” type a branch name (like README edits), and then hit “create branch.” Branches are ideal for new features or bug fixes.
</p>
<img src="images/gitbanch.jpg" alt="use of branch" style="width: 450px; height: 300px;">

<h3 id="subtitle5">5-Create and Commit Changes to a Branch</h3>
<p>
To make changes to a branch on GitHub, go to the code view of the branch you just created. Click the file you want to change, then press the pencil icon in the top right, make any necessary edits, write a save message describing your changes, and then click “Commit changes.” Each change that is recorded is called a transaction. Each commit has its own commit message that gives more details about why a particular change was made. Commit messages give a change history and help project contributors understand how the project has changed over time.
</p>

<h3 id="subtitle6">6-Open a Pull Request</h3>
<p>
    To merge any branch into branches someone else is working on, you must open a pull request. A pull request is GitHub's way of notifying interested parties of your request to commit changes to branches. A pull request will show content differences between branches in red and green. You can request a pull at any time once you complete a transaction. For best results, when submitting a pull request, you can use the “@” attribute to mention specific people you need feedback from.
    
    To open a pull request, you go to the “Pull Request” tab and press the button that says “new pull request.” Then, in the “example comparisons” box, find the branch you made and compare it with the parent volume.
</p>
<h3 id="subtitle7">7-Merge Your Pull Request</h3>
<p>
    
Merging your pull request into the main project is something you may need to escalate to your superiors to handle. For learning, however, you can practice on your own. Simply click on the button that says “Merge pull request”, then click “Merge confirm” and then delete the branch you merged into once it is merged into the master branch.
</p>



<h2 id="part5">Promoting Your GitHub Profile</h2>
<p>
GitHub is a great place to not only expand your programming knowledge, but also showcase your best work. Your GitHub Profile is a great place for recruiters to find you and learn about potential jobs and projects. Many people try to gain GitHub followers by writing engaging and useful blog posts or even creating podcasts or YouTube GitHub tutorials. The more followers you have, the more opportunities will be open to you and the greater ability you will have to become a thought leader in the programming field.
</p>
<h2 id="part6">Learning and Grow with GitHub</h2>
<p>
The best programmers are constantly learning new things all the time. The software world is constantly evolving and new problems are solved with code every day. To maintain your vitality, you need to constantly discover new ways to solve problems. You need to try new things and collaborate with other programmers. The coding community is close-knit, but also large. GitHub has a wealth of features that allow you to collaborate and learn from the best in the industry. Take some time to explore GitHub and discover how you can unlock your full potential and become an expert programmer.
